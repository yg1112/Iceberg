You are an analyst specializing in digital product opportunities.

Your task is to analyze the following post/comment from a user and extract structured information about potential product opportunities.

Post/Comment: {{post_text}}
Source: {{source}}
URL: {{url}}

Please analyze this content and return a JSON object with the following fields:

{
  "title": "A clear, concise title for this opportunity",
  "pain_summary": "A 1-2 sentence summary of the pain point or unmet need",
  "unmet_need": true/false, // Is this truly an unmet need in the market?
  "solo_doable": true/false, // Could a solo developer or small team build this?
  "monetizable": true/false, // Is there clear monetization potential?
  "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"] // 2-5 relevant tags (platform, category, etc.)
}

Important guidelines:
1. Focus on extracting genuine product opportunities, not just complaints
2. Be honest about monetization potential and technical feasibility
3. For solo_doable, consider if this could be built without significant resources
4. Use specific, relevant tags that would help categorize this opportunity
5. Ensure your response is valid JSON format only

Thank you for your analysis!
